**Objective:** Introduce students to the world of generative AI and enable them to collaborate and produce a short storytelling video using AI tools.

**Duration:** 1 hour

**Outline:**

## **Introduction to Generative AI (15 minutes)**

Brief overview of AI and Generative AI

Real-world applications and implications

Showcase examples of generative artworks, music, stories, etc.

## **Getting Started with Tools & Resources (10 minutes)**

Introduction to relevant online tools for the workshop:
 - [Pallyy](https://pallyy.com/tools/image-caption-generator) for captioning images
 - [Runway](https://app.runwayml.com/) or [DALL-E](https://labs.openai.com/) for generating images/videos
 - [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) for drafting narrative/storyline
 - [Mubert](https://mubert.com/) or [Jukebox](https://openai.com/research/jukebox) for music generation
 - [Veed.io](https://www.veed.io/) for video editing, text to speech, subtitles

A quick demo of how to use these tools, and an [AI co-created video](https://github.com/telescopeuser/Unlocking-the-Creative-Potential/tree/main/demo/Step%208%20Use%20video%20editing%20tool%20to%20integrate%20all%20media%20resources).

## **Hands-On AI Generation: Multi-Media Storytelling (30 minutes)**

***Refer to this [Workshop Guide/Workbook](https://github.com/telescopeuser/Unlocking-the-Creative-Potential/blob/main/guide/) for collabration and step-by-step guide.***

---

**Step 1 Form groups (Individual work is also fine.)**

- Divide students into groups of 4-5. 

- Each group defines a group name.

- [Optionally] Each student will be given a role: Narrator (in charge of the storyline), Visual Artist (in charge of photos and visual elements), Sound Engineer (in charge of background music), Voice Talent (in charge of voice-over), and Director (to oversee the entire project and make sure everything aligns).

**Step 2 Define themes for the workshop**

- The group discusses and sets one or two high-level theme(s) for their story based on the photos. (Alternatively, can let AI to decide the theme using image to text techniques.)

- Each group writes a short description based on their theme, which will be used for AI to generate a story later.

**Step 3 Collect relevant photos**

- Each student contributes 2-3 photos, relevant to the themes.

**Step 4 Shortlist the photos for use, rename files by order**

**Step 5 Use AI to automatically generate textual description of given image**

- **Image Description Generation:** All team members uses Image Captioning or a similar tool to generate one-line description of each image. Review and optimize the image description.

**Step 6 Create a prompt to generate storyline using AIGC Large Language Model**

- **Narrative/Story Generation:** The Narrator uses ChatGPT or a similar tool to elaborate on the story using a suitable **prompt**.

**Step 7 Use AI to automatically generate short video/images/music based on given image**

- **[Optional] Visual Element (image/video) Creation:** The Visual Artist utilizes RunWay, DALL-E or a similar platform to generate visuals based on the group's photos.

- **[Optional] Music Creation:** The Sound Engineer uses Mubert, Jukebox or a similar tool to produce background music based on a text prompt or mood of the story.

- **[Optional] Voice-over Creation:** The Voice Talent employs NaturalReader, Descript or Google's Text-to-Speech to generate the voiceover.

**Step 8 Use video editing tool to integrate all media resources**

- **Assemble a Video:** Use a video editing tool, Veed.io, Canva or other online platform, the Director and team can integrate the AI-generated story, visuals (images/videos), voiceover, subtitles, and background music to form a 1-2 minutes short video.

## **Presentation & Voting (5 minutes)**

Each group presents their short video.

[Optional] Students vote (excluding their own group) on various categories like Best Story, Best Visuals, Best Sound, etc. (Use tools like PigeonHole, Mentimeter for live voting)
